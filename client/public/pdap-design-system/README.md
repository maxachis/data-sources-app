# Design System
These are styling resources like CSS and templates for new PDAP microservices or branded web projects.

Open `system/demo.html` to see how things look.
`global-styles.css` are the styles used across all PDAP applications.
`normalize.css` is used for more consistent cross-browser rendering.

# Context
We are making tools for transparency about a serious subject. We are be focused, friendly, and open.

## Principles
This is a first pass, so they're not etched in stone. Open to suggestions.

- Our design should take accessibility seriously. 
- Keep it simple: things should not do anything they don't need to do. 
- We should keep our users informed and in control with timely, relevant feedback.
- Things that look the same should behave in the same way, and an action should always produce the same result.
- Don't reinvent the wheel: use standard conventions and cues.
- Provide help to people in context, not in the docs.
- Establish good visual hierarchy by ensuring each page and object has a primary function.
